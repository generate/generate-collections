## Usage

Use as a plugin, to initialize commonly used [view collections](#collections-created) (no views are actually added to the collections).

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(require('{%= name %}'));
  // do other generator stuff
};
```

## Collections created

Adds the following view collections to your generator:

### Renderable

Templates for files intended to be written to the file system. 

* `files`

**Example usage**

```js
app.files('templates/*.md');
```

### Layouts

Templates to be used as layouts (for "wrapping" other templates or content):

* `layouts`

```js
app.layouts('templates/layouts/*.md');
```

### Partials

Templates to be used as partials (for injecting into other templates)

* `includes`
* `badges`
* `docs`


```js
app.partials('templates/partials/*.md');
```

## Smart plugin
{%= include("base/smart-plugin.md") %}
